<h1>Automatic File Organizer</h1>
<p>
  This is a python program that will automatically organize your files for you. It depends on what data reference that is currently indicated in the dictionary of the program.
  This application current designation will be at C:\Users\You\Downloads (well supposed to be...). Once the python script was executed, the files in the designation will be instantly moved to their designated path.

  Special thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiffInTech"><strong>Tiff In Tech</stron></a> in YT for sharing and explaining the code for us!

Tried my best to add comments explaining how the code works by flow, hope you understand it!
